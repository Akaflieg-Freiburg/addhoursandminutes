**Add Times**  is a simple calculator app that adds times given in hours and minutes. It helps with the recording of machine running times, or with the addition of flight times in your pilotsâ€™ flight log.  The program has been written by Stefan Kebekus, as a project of [Akaflieg Freiburg](https://akaflieg-freiburg.de), a flight club based in Freiburg, Germany.
