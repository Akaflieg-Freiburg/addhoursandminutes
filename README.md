# Add Times

**Add Times** is a simple calculator app that adds times given in
hours and minutes. It helps with the recording of machine running times, with
the addition of flight times in your pilots' flight log, or your driving times
as a truck driver. The app is free, open-source, 100% non-commercial, and does
not collect user data.
